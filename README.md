# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

The objective of our project is to model the Theseus and the Minotaur project via propositional statements and constraints. Each round, both Theseus and the Minotaur move, the Minotaur moves two spaces towards Theseus, and Theseus moves one space towards the exit, or "goal" square. The game sets a 6x6 grid with random conditions, such as: location of hedges, number of rounds, and location of Theseus and the Minotaur. Based on these constraints, our goal is to calculate whether a given game is "winnable" for Theseus.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: **THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN FIND OUR CURRENT CODE IN THIS BRANCH.**
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
