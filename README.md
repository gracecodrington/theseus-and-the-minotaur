# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to our project!

We modelled the Theseus and the Minotaur problem in propositional logic. The idea of our project is to create a randomized maze setting, and determine whether or not Theseus can escape, given certain rules.

You can find our final Python code under the file run.py.
You can find documentation of our code in the folder "final" within the folder "documents".
In that same folder, you can find our Jape sequents and proofs.
Within our Python code is a link to a google document that details our progress throughout the term. It can be found at line 6 in our code.


## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
